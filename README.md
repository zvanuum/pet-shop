# pet-shop

A Twitter bot for messing around :^) (and for learning to deploy things to my Google Kubernetes Engine)
Currently the message used for tweeting is hard-coded in main.go, could be extracted to config.json as a template message then loaded in or something.


### Building and Running


- To build the binary:
`go build -o pet-shop .`

- To run the program:
`go run ./*.go`
